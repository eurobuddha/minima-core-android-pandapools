/**
 * The trading family that shares ONE Trading Account (the same 24 words give the same keys in each): Dexicon, AtomiX,
 * PandaPools. Owner, 10 Nov: they are mutually exclusive on a phone. Two installed apps holding the same keys would keep
 * separate one-time-signature counters and reuse leaves, so an account is only ever CREATED or RESTORED while no other
 * family app is installed ({@link AccountSetup} refuses otherwise). The app already holding the account keeps settling
 * what it has open (claims and refunds must never be stranded); new trading is stopped by each app's own hand-over gate.
 *
 * <p>Each app lists every package below in its manifest {@code <queries>} so it can see the others (Android 11+).
