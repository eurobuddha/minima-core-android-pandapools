/**
 * The trading family on one phone (owner, 11 Nov 2026): **AtomiX + PandaPools, or Dexicon** — never both.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>AtomiX and PandaPools run side by side and share ONE Trading Account (the same 24 words as Dexicon). They never
 *       block each other: each signs only its own share of every key's one-time leaves (AccountKeys leaf slots), so
 *       their separate counters can never land on the same leaf.</li>
 *   <li>Dexicon (which contains AtomiX and PandaPools) is the alternative to that pair.</li>
 *   <li>Two builds of the SAME app (a release and its ".stock" test build) share a leaf slot, so they are exclusive too.</li>
 * </ul>
 * An account is only CREATED or RESTORED while no conflicting app is installed ({@link AccountSetup} and
 * {@link AccountVault} refuse otherwise). Dexicon's own TradingGate also stops its trading while AtomiX or PandaPools
 * is installed.
 *
 * <p>Each app lists every package below in its manifest {@code <queries>} so it can see the others (Android 11+).
