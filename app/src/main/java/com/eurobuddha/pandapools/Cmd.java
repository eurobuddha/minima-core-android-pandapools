/**
 * One parser for node-command parameters, shared by every guard that reads a command it is about to run.
 *
 * WHY ONE. Two guard layers used to parse the same command differently. {@code CmdChain} took the FIRST
 * matching token; {@code TxPost} kept the LAST. On a well-formed command they agree, so nothing ever went
 * wrong — but on a command carrying {@code coinid:} twice they disagree, and those two layers do different
 * jobs with the answer: TxPost locks the coin and authorises the signature, CmdChain verifies the coin at the
 * signature boundary. Disagreeing means authorising one coin and verifying another.
 *
 * WHY IT REFUSES RATHER THAN RESOLVES. There is no correct answer to "which coinid did they mean". A duplicate
 * parameter in a fund-moving command is a bug or an injection attempt, and picking either value would be
 * guessing about which coins get spent. So {@link #param} returns null, and callers must treat null as
 * "refuse this command" — the same fail-closed rule the rest of the signing path follows.
