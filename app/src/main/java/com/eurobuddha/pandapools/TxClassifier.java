/**
 * Turns a raw {@link HistoryEntry} into an accounting-shaped transaction: what kind of PandaPools action it
 * was, which pool it touched, how much of each leg moved, and the price that implies.
 *
 * Everything is derived from data already stored on-device — the per-token wallet {@code deltas} and the
 * coin arrays. Nothing is estimated and no node call is made, so an export is reproducible offline and
 * gives the same answer every time.
 *
 * {@link ActivityLog} deliberately is NOT used as the source of truth: it holds only a prose summary (no
 * tokenid, no leg amounts), is capped at 60 entries, and is device-local. The transaction's own shape is
 * both more complete and more reliable.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS in {@link #classify}. Two traps:
 *   • A migrate and a keep-fresh both spend AND recreate pool coins. They are told apart by ADDRESS —
 *     a refresh recreates at the SAME covenant address, a migrate exits the old one and creates a NEW one.
 *   • A keep-fresh moves no token and only dust MINIMA, so testing it before the deposit/withdraw rules
 *     stops it being booked as liquidity movement (it is neither — it is a maintenance transaction).
