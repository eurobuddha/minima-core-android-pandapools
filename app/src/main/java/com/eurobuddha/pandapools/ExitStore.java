/**
 * A durable record of every automatic withdrawal attempted, and how far it got.
 *
 * IT GRANTS NOTHING. No guard reads this file. Authority lives only in {@link ExitAuthority}, in memory, for the
 * duration of one signature — so a crash cannot leave a standing permission behind. What this store provides is
 * the other two things a fund-moving automatic action needs:
 *
 *   IDEMPOTENCY. A withdrawal marked {@code POSTING} is never retried automatically on relaunch. The one thing
 *   worse than a stranded pool is two closes against the same coins, both signing, each burning an owner leaf.
 *   So an interrupted exit becomes a card the user resolves, not a chain the app re-runs on its own.
 *
 *   A LIFETIME CAP. {@code signatures} only ever rises, per covenant address, and is checked before any new
 *   ticket is issued. Re-issuing after a failure is allowed a couple of times; it can never become an open
 *   unlock, however many times a restore is re-run.
 *
 * Terminal records are never deleted. They are the audit trail for a transaction the user did not press a button
 * for, which is exactly the history someone will want to reconstruct later.
