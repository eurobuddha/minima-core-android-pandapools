/**
 * Holds the ONE outstanding exit exemption, in memory, for as long as a single signature needs it.
 *
 * Three properties, each chosen against a specific way this could go wrong.
 *
 * NEVER PERSISTED. A crash, a kill, a relaunch — none of them can leave a standing exemption behind. If the
 * process dies mid-exit there is nothing on disk that would let the next launch sign without re-deciding from
 * scratch. {@link ExitStore} does persist a record of what was attempted, for idempotency and audit, but it
 * grants no authority: the guards never read it.
 *
 * AT MOST ONE AT A TIME. Not a map. {@link RestoreExit} posts strictly serially, so a second concurrent
 * exemption would mean a bug, and making that structurally impossible is cheaper than detecting it. "There is
 * never more than one outstanding exemption" is then a property you can read off this file.
 *
 * SINGLE USE. {@link #consume} clears the grant, so one grant admits one signature. An exit needs two, and
 * {@link RestoreExit} grants the second explicitly for the forward stage — so even a bug that re-ran a signing
 * chain could not spend a third leaf on the back of one decision.
 *
 * The guards call {@link #permits} and nothing else. They do not receive a ticket, cannot be handed one, and
 * cannot be told to skip the check: authority is looked up, never passed in.
