/**
 * Layer 5 (network discoverability): keep a live announce beacon in the recent sentinel window for pools,
 * so STRANGERS' fresh nodes keep rediscovering them after the original beacon pruned.
 *
 * GOSSIP: a pool stays discoverable only while a live beacon sits in the recent window, and the beacon is
 * unspendable dust that prunes (~a day). If re-announcing were owner-only, a pool created on a now-offline
 * phone would go dark for everyone. So this re-announces EVERY funded pool the node knows (its own +
 * any it has discovered/tracked), turning discovery into a self-healing mesh: as long as one active node
 * knows a funded pool, its beacon stays alive for new users. Always-on nodes (desktop/MDS) are the anchors.
 * Re-announcing another's pool is safe — {@link PoolManager#reannounce} spends no covenant coin and needs
 * no owner signature; it just posts a dust beacon carrying the pool's public params (which the node holds).
 *
 * It re-announces ONLY a pool whose beacon has actually FADED from the recent window — so beacons never
 * pile up — and shuffles + caps each run so many nodes don't all re-beacon the same pools at once.
 *
 * HARD GUARD: the sentinel scan here NEVER uses {@code megammr:true} — that query (pulling the whole
 * accumulated beacon pile) was the 0.8.10 crash, not the re-announce itself. Recent unpruned window only.
