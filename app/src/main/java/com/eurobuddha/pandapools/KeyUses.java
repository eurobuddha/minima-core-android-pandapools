/**
 * Reads a key's one-time-signature use counter out of a {@code keys action:list} reply. Read-only.
 *
 * WHY THE COUNTER MATTERS. Minima signatures are stateful: each key is a 64-ary, 3-level Winternitz tree and
 * every signature must consume the NEXT leaf. Signing one leaf twice, over two different messages, leaks that
 * leaf's private key. Observed in the wild — see the 0.9.22 entry in CHANGELOG.md, where 7 of 64 default keys on
 * a live node were flagged {@code RE-USED x2}.
 *
 * A pool's owner key ($OPK) is minted with {@code newaddress}, so a seed-only re-sync does not bring it back:
 * {@code initDefaultKeys} rebuilds only the 64 default keys. Worse, a node inserts every new key at
 * {@code uses = 0}:
 *
 * <pre>Wallet.createNewKey:  SQL_CREATE_PUBLIC_KEY.setInt(3, treekey.getUses());   // a fresh TreeKey -> 0</pre>
 *
 * A key re-minted that way is byte-identical to the one that already signed, but its counter has forgotten
 * everything — so the next owner action would sign a leaf that was already spent on a different transaction.
 * The node's own restore margins do not help: {@code restore.java} (+256) and {@code vault.java} (=100) both
 * run BEFORE an owner key is re-minted, and only touch keys that exist at that moment.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLASS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not advance a counter, and nothing in this app does.
 *
 * There is no command to set one — {@code keys} offers only {@code list / genkey / checkkeys / new /
 * createallkeys}, {@code updateAllKeyUses} rewrites all 64 defaults at once, and the private key cannot be
 * fetched to sign locally ({@code KeyRow.toJSON()} has {@code privatekey} commented out). The only way a node
 * exposes to move a counter is to actually spend the leaves, by repeatedly calling {@code sign}.
 *
 * 0.9.23 did exactly that: it estimated where a restored key should resume (recorded count + elapsed blocks /
 * REFRESH_BLOCKS + slack) and burned leaves up to that target. 0.9.47 reversed it, and the burn code is deleted
 * as of 0.9.48, because the approach cannot work:
 *
 *   - burning cannot undo a reuse that already happened;
 *   - the target is a guess — a signature the original node made that never reached the chain, or one made
 *     after the last backup, is invisible to every term in that sum;
 *   - and burning IS signing, so climbing past an unknown high-water mark re-signs every leaf on the way up.
 *
 * So signing state is never reconstructed or estimated. It is either present, as the matching current
 * MinimaCore wallet backup, or the recipe stays signing-quarantined. {@link OwnerKeyRecovery} reads counters
 * through {@link #extractUses} and fails closed; a counter below a recipe's recorded floor blocks signing
 * outright. Do not reintroduce a burn path.
