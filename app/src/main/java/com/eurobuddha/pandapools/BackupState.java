/**
 * Tracks whether the off-device pool backup still covers every pool this node owns.
 *
 * The on-device recipe store ({@link OwnPoolStore}) is written synchronously before any create or migrate is
 * posted, so a recipe is never lost to a crash. But it is app-private and deliberately excluded from cloud
 * backup — see {@code res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml}, which allows only a direct device transfer. So it dies
 * with the phone, and the ONLY thing that survives a lost or wiped device is the file the user exported.
 *
 * That file is therefore not optional, and "I exported one once" is not the same as "it covers my pools". A
 * backup taken before a pool was created cannot recover that pool. This class reduces the question to one
 * comparison: a digest over the set of owned covenant addresses, recorded when an export is VERIFIED, against
 * the same digest computed now.
 *
 * Deliberately stored in {@code pandapools_recovery} (the recovery-settings namespace shared with
 * {@link ArchiveNode}) rather than {@code pandapools_ownpools}: {@link OwnPoolStore#all} iterates every key in
 * its file and parses each value as a recipe, so a fund-critical store should not gain non-recipe keys.
