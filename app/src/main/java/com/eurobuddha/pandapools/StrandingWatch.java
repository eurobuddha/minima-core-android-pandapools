/**
 * Warns the owner, out loud, before a pool ages out of the chain's recent window.
 *
 * This is the root cause of every recovery problem in this app. A pool's reserve coins must be recreated roughly
 * twice a day; when they are not, they fall into the megammr-only archive and every light node — the owner's own
 * included — goes blind to them. MY LP then shows "No pools yet" and there is nothing to withdraw. Everything
 * else PandaPools does about recovery is cleanup after this has already happened.
 *
 * Until now the only warning was an amber line inside a pool's card, which the user sees only by opening the app
 * and scrolling to it — and the population that needs the warning is precisely the one whose app has not been
 * running. So it is a notification, on its own high-importance channel.
 *
 * Two audiences, two actions:
 *   a pool that simply has not been refreshed can be fixed in place, so it is offered Re-publish;
 *   a signing-quarantined pool can NEVER self-heal, because keep-fresh refuses to sign for it, so it is offered
 *   Withdraw instead. Telling that user to Re-publish would be telling them to press a button that cannot work.
