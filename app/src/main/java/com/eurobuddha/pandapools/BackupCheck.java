/**
 * Checks a backup file WITHOUT changing anything: no recipe is saved, no covenant is tracked, no coin proof is
 * imported, no transaction is built and nothing is signed.
 *
 * Why this exists as its own path. Restore is the only thing that has ever read a backup file, and it writes —
 * it saves recipes, tracks covenants and imports proofs. So the only way to find out whether a backup was any
 * good was to commit to restoring it. Once Restore also withdraws, that becomes unacceptable: "let me check my
 * file" must not be a fund-moving operation. This is the look-only path, and it ships before Restore ever spends.
 *
 * It also answers the question a user actually has, which "the file exists" does not: can this file still
 * recover my pool on this node, today. That means checking the recipe re-derives its covenant, whether the
 * reserves are visible here, whether this wallet even holds the owner key, and — the one that matters most —
 * whether the node's signature counter has fallen BELOW what the backup recorded, which is the shape that
 * precedes a key-reuse accident.
 *
 * Read-only-ness is enforced by {@link #readOnly}, an allowlist, rather than by review. Every command this class
 * issues goes through it, so a future edit that reaches for {@code coinimport}, {@code newscript} or {@code sign}
 * fails closed instead of quietly writing during a "check".
