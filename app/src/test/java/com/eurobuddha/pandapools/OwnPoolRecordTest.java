/**
 * What a stored recipe records about provenance and retirement.
 *
 * THE INCIDENT THIS PINS. On 0.9.56 a user with two pools and no recovery problems saw FOUR amber cards:
 * two "Saved pool · reserves unavailable" and two "Owner signing paused". Both causes live in this file's
 * subject, {@link OwnPoolStore#mergeRecord}:
 *
 *   1. Close and migrate kept the old recipe forever (OwnPoolStore.remove() had no callers), so every
 *      pool ever closed left an undismissable card behind. The fix RETIRES rather than deletes, because a
 *      recipe is the only thing that can reclaim a pool and a posted close can still fail to land — so
 *      retirement must survive a re-record and must be reversible.
 *   2. The rediscovered-pool card was blamed on the signing quarantine, and 0.9.58 cleared it at the
 *      backfill. That was WRONG and 0.9.60 reverted it: holding the key is not holding the counter, and a
 *      cleared hold lets keep-fresh sign unattended after a seed restore. The card was confusing because it
 *      was unlabelled and duplicated, which is fixed elsewhere; the quarantine itself was right.
