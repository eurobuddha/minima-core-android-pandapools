/**
 * Getting withdrawn funds off a pool's owner payout address, and not stopping early.
 *
 * THE INCIDENT THIS PINS. Pool
 * MxG081BJGW3KQ0PBPHCS841CC5RA7YKRVEQUE93Z353MT4FBTJ2101S1423Z1ET closed on 2026-09-14, paying
 * 585050.29830926161 MINIMA and 2934.95626348 MxUSD to a single $OADR
 * (0x0A10CC6952D404ED3DF2C9B3221AE622F35CF788CFBD4EED0E486D9F98CD6675). The forward ran while only the
 * MINIMA leg met its `coinage:3 sendable:true` filter, moved that, reported success — and the retry loop
 * stopped. The MxUSD is still there, and the device holding the owner key has since died, so it cannot
 * be signed for at all.
 *
 * Two mistakes caused it, and both are what these tests forbid:
 *   1. treating a forward that POSTED as the job being finished, when it only moved what it could see;
 *   2. giving up at all — 8 tries, 20 s apart, only while one screen was alive.
 *
 * So: CLEAR is reachable only from an empty read, and nothing about a forward's outcome can reach it.
